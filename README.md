# freeCodeCamp-solutions
My freeCodeCamp curriculum solutions.

I'm also going to track my second round of 100 days of code progress here so I don't have to update two repos.

Day 1 - Worked through the Basic HTML and HTML5 curriculum.

Day 2 - Started working on Basic CSS.

Day 3 - Continued working on Basic CSS.
